# Aloha Amigos! ðŸ‘‹

I am HaydenDev, and I'm a Discord Bot Developer with over 3-2+ years of experience. I'm passionate about creating bots that enhance the Discord experience for users.

# What I Do?

I programe Discord Bots using the [Discord API](https://discord.dev) in-order to help communities thrive. Here are some example bot's I created/or are in development:
- Aja: A Discord bot designed purposed for providing high-security to keep your members safe.
- Lyon: A Multipurpose Discord bot that has features such as (Logging, Economy, Moderation, Administration, and more!).
- Server Utilites: Like usual bots, but specifically purposed for organizing and maintaing your community in-order to keep it thriving.

I'm almost an expert in the field of designing, creating, and developing Discord bots for making servers thrive. I'm decently experienced in Programming languages such as JavaScript, TypeScript, Python.

# My Process.

When I work on a new project, I look at what frameworks I use/and what languages I am going to use, I usually make all my projects with **A. TypeScript** or **B. JavaScript** it's very unlikely I use **JavaScript** I value TypeScript more. I generally look at the different aspects of making a new project like, what's it's name, what's it's file structure going to look like?, and more.

From there, I can start to create my bot or Web App.
